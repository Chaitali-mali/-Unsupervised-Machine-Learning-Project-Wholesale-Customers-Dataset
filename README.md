🛒 Unsupervised Machine Learning Project | Wholesale Customers Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to the Wholesale Customers Dataset, which contains spending patterns of different clients. The goal is to perform Customer Segmentation to help businesses identify distinct groups of customers and make data-driven decisions.

🔑 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Apply KMeans Clustering to group customers

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction & visualization

Interpret customer segments for real-world marketing & business insights

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Clustering & PCA)

📊 Workflow

Load & explore dataset

Data preprocessing & normalization

Apply KMeans Clustering

Find the optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method

Use PCA to reduce data dimensions

Visualize clusters in 2D space

Analyze & interpret customer groups
